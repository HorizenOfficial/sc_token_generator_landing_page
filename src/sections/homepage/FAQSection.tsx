                            TokenMint will go through a phased rollout to ensure security since the very beginning.
                            Horizen Labs will protect and limit the access to TokenMint nodes until the staked amount
                            will be enough to consider attacks unlikely to happen. At that point node operators will
                            strenghten security and decentralization.

                            The Token Generator makes two transactions when creating a token, the new token declaration and minting. The new token transaction comes with a fee of 0.42 ZEN during the alpha phase to reduce non-serious participants.

                            You can create both fungible tokens and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the TokenMint network
                            currently. We are looking to support interoperability in the future.

                            tokens or an unlimited supply of tokens.
